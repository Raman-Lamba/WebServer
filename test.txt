 1. I just received an angry text from my ex: "I hope you burn in hell for what you've done!"
No idea how he managed to send that text without fingers.
2. I thought it was cute that my cat always randomly stares at me.
Then I realized he was looking at something just behind me.
3. I rage-quit after losing to the final boss for the 13th time.
As I was shutting off the computer, I noticed my avatar pounding on the screen, begging me not to leave him alone.
4. They say there's nothing like the laughter of a child.
To that I say, "Unless it's 2am, and you're home alone."
